The steps to write the code for the applet are:

build a java file
create its .class file
design a webpage using the html tags
make the applet tag

and add that applet there then we can test that code,

we will require the 2 classes namely the applet and the graphics classes
to make the program.

applet class provides the life and behaviour to the user designed applet.

The execution is decided when the regulatory methods to run the applet are
called by the jvm

Applet will carry out the lifecycle of the applet
Graphics class will lie in the java.awt.*; 

awt stands for the abstract windowing toolkit.
