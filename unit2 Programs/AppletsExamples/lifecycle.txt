Applet lifecycle

Born (initialization age)
Running state
Idle state
Dead/Destroyed state

to make an applet program , we will make a class and get it inheriting the 
applet class by:
    
    class demo extends Applet{
        //code
    }

every applet program needs to inherit the Applet class
applet is load is in its initialisation (born state)
Then after born will start  to be in the running state
Then will show the output using the paint method.
we can stop the applet into the stop state.
We need to do the idle state then only we will use the destroy() to kill it.

initialisation of the applet occurs once

we need the override the init method like

public void init(){

}

to do the start of the applet
public void start(){

}
suppose we temporarily switch to some other tab while the applet was running
it will switch back to its idle state.

public void stop(){

} it can be called automatically when we will close / quit the page or switch to other page.

public void destroy(){

} is called when you close the browser

There is a state in which the applet has to display its content , it will use
the paint method that is :

public void paint(Graphics g){

} we actually do not consider it as the part of the lifecycle.
