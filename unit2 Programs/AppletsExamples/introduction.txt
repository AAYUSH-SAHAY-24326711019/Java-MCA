we can make the applications and applets
applets are the programs for internet computing.
we can transmit it over the internet. We will always use a java -enabled web browser
we will also view it with the help of an applet viewer

it can do the graphics / multi media and the user input with a gui.
This could work anywhere. There was interactivity with the programs running
multimedia on the internet. They were used over the internet

Applets are 2 types : local applet made locally ,running on the local machine and
will not require the internet and will work by searching the files and folders.

Internet applet is made and stored on a remote server and installed on a remote 
client / made public over the internet. So that anyone could fetch , we can 
download that and run over our computer.

applet does not have a main method , they dont run independently , we need to 
make it the part of a webpage . They cannot read / write to the local file system.
That cannot communicate to the other server. and cannot run the other programs.
It is restricted to use the libraries of the python and c++ present over the computer.
java will do that using its native methods.

Need:

to add something dynamic over the webpage by the applet.
when need flash output , to show animation. This can be used by the other clients
after download it. '


we will require a java enabled webrowser to run it.
Since we can see that its depreciated since java 9
and then we will need jdk 8.

We will make the 3 things in the bin folder of the jdk 8 location
that is the program1.java , program1.class and program1.html
We will also able to view only the applet part by the help
of command

appletviewer program1.html (This will also come with the jdk 8).

Since awt , JavaFx and Swing are the modern alternatives of applet
